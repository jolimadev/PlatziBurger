# PlatziBurger
Home Page of Burger's Restaurant (responsive)

Welcome to PLATZIFOOD the best restaurant of burger's at Github.

This project was made it with Tailwind.CSS and a little of Html5 (and if your read the code you can see a three or four lines scripts of ALPINE.JS) 

I use tailwind because it's now my favorite framework of css, his utility and the way it saves me time instead of creating several style.css, plus the usability of applying your styles in html faster.

Alpine.js it's something new for me, my mentor suggested to me to try, and i can tell alpine.js is good, not bad, as it allows me to apply JS without the need to create a new separate file.

Well, right bellow us i will link some screen of the project and in the Repository you can see the code.
